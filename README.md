## What is this

This is the repo for Haven Archive. A minimal website to store and protect precious digital treasure.

Haven Archive is powered by Sanity Studio using a separate repo: https://github.com/wentallout/haven-studio

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
